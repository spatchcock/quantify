module Quantify

  # The Dimensions class represents specfic physical quantities in
  # terms of powers of their constituent base dimensions, e.g.:
  # 
  # area = length^2
  # force = mass^1 x length^1 x time^-2
  # 
  # Each dimension object is characterised by instance variables
  # which describe the power (or index) of the respective base dimensions.
  # Dimension objects can be manipulated - multiplied, divided, raised
  # to powers, etc.
  #
  # Standard physical quantities (e.g. length, acceleration, energy)
  # are loaded into the @@dimensions class variable at runtime. These
  # can be accessed, used and manipulated for arbitrary dimensional uses.
  # 
  # Instances of Dimensions are also used as the basis for defining and
  # manipulating objects of the Unit::Base class.
